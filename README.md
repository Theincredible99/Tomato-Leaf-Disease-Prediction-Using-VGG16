# Tomato-Leaf-Disease-Prediction-Using-VGG16

# Problem Statement :
Manual plant disease detection methods are time-consuming and
inefficient, particularly for large-scale farms. Traditional disease detection
techniques, such as visual inspection, are susceptible to errors and often require a team of experts. Moreover, early disease detection is essential to
control and prevent plant diseases, which traditional techniques cannot
guarantee. Therefore, there is a need for an accurate, efficient, and automated
disease detection approach for tomato plants that can provide early detection
and effective prevention.

# Objectives:
The main objective of this project is to develop an automated system for
detecting and classifying tomato leaf diseases using CNN.
Develop a CNN model that can accurately detect and classify common
tomato leaf diseases.
In this project i used Transfer Learning Technique with VGG16 Pretrained model. 

# Dataset Collection : 
The dataset is taken from kaggle website : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/noulam/tomato/data
It consist of around 23000 images of (256,256) size.
Train data : around 18000 images
Test data : around 5000 images 

# VGG16 model Architechture :
