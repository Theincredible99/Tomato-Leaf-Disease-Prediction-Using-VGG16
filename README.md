# Tomato-Leaf-Disease-Prediction-Using-VGG16

Problem Statement :
Manual plant disease detection methods are time-consuming and
inefficient, particularly for large-scale farms. Traditional disease detection
techniques, such as visual inspection, are susceptible to errors and often require a team of experts. Moreover, early disease detection is essential to
control and prevent plant diseases, which traditional techniques cannot
guarantee. Therefore, there is a need for an accurate, efficient, and automated
disease detection approach for tomato plants that can provide early detection
and effective prevention.

Objectives:
The main objective of this project is to develop an automated system for
detecting and classifying tomato leaf diseases using CNN.
Develop a CNN model that can accurately detect and classify common
tomato leaf diseases.
In this project i used Transfer Learning Technique with VGG16 Pretrained model.
